This is a scraper that creates a csv file, `execorders.csv` by running the script `scrape_exec_orders.R` to scrape the data and save the scraped data using R.

It is currently run by triggering the Github action workflow that runs the scraper and commits an updated CSV file if the scraper obtains new data.
